# Nominal Flight Path Generator (Updated with LLM)

A  flight path generation system producing realistic aircraft trajectories with three levels of variation, built on aircraft physics models and statistical pattern extraction.

## Overview

The **Nominal Flight Path Generator** creates realistic flight trajectories between airports based on historical data patterns and aircraft performance constraints. The system generates three distinct types of routes for comparison:

- **Nominal routes (red lines):** Authentic flight paths extracted from historical AirAsia flight data, representing the most common trajectory between airports.
- **Strictly nominal routes (green lines):** Controlled variations that closely follow nominal paths with small, deterministic deviations using sinusoidal patterns.
- **Synthetic routes (blue lines):** Realistic alternative paths with larger variations that still adhere to aircraft physics constraints.

All generated routes respect real-world aircraft performance limitations, including minimum turn radius calculations based on speed and bank angle constraints.

## Features

- **Triple comparison visualization:** View nominal, strictly nominal, and synthetic routes side-by-side.
- **Physics-based constraints:** Realistic turn radius calculations based on aircraft speed.
- **Kalman filter smoothing:** Advanced trajectory smoothing for realistic path generation.
- **Correlated variations:** Continuous, smooth variations instead of independent point randomization.
- **Customizable variation levels:** Control the amount of deviation from nominal paths.
- **Aircraft performance models:** Routes respect aircraft-specific performance characteristics.
- **SID/STAR integration:** Incorporates real-world departure and arrival procedures.
- **KML export:** Generate visualization files compatible with Google Earth.
- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface for route generation and visualization.

## Usage

### GUI Mode

1. Launch the application without parameters:  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. Select aircraft type from the dropdown menu.
3. Choose departure and arrival airports.
4. Adjust settings (variation level, detail level, etc.).
5. Click **"Generate Flight Path"** to create routes.
6. Use **"Visualize Last Generated"** to view the paths.

### Command Line Mode

Generate a single route:
```sh
python main.py --departure WSSS --arrival WMKK --aircraft A320-214 --visualize
```

Generate multiple routes with variation:
```sh
python main.py --departure WSSS --arrival WMKK --aircraft A320-214 --routes 5 --visualize
```

## Interface Instructions

The application interface includes:

### Basic Options:
- **Aircraft Selection:** Choose from various Airbus models.
- **Airport Selection:** Search and select from 80,000+ global airports.

### Advanced Options:
- **Detail Level:** Controls waypoint density (**Low/Medium/High**).
- **Route Count:** Number of synthetic routes to generate (**1-20**).
- **Variation Level:** Controls deviation from nominal path (**0.05-0.4**).
- **Strict Nominal Deviation:** Controls green line deviation amount (**km**).
- **Visualization Options:** KML/JSON/CSV output formats.
- **Status Bar:** Shows progress and operation information.
